    processing:
      i) make an initial static graph self.static_graph as follows:
        1) initialize self.static_graph with all the nodes in self.backbone_graph
        2) add more edges between the existing nodes without violating the degree constraint 
          i.e. self.fso_per_node
      
      ii) create pool of nodes i.e. available nodes
           from new_nodes_for_step_4, that exist in self.adj but not in self.backbone_graph 
           IMP: available nodes will be reduced as the processing goes on
           
      iii) while (available nodes list is non-empty) and 
          (number of nodes in static graph < max_no_of_node for static graph)
          1. create a new flow-graph, adding super-source and super-sink and unit capacity to each
            link from the existing static graph
          2. solve max-flow on this flow-graph and compute residual graph
          3. for every node n in the residual graph:
            a) compute source-potential of n by treating n as the supersource
            b) compute sink-potential of n by treating n as the supersink
            
          4. for every pair of nodes u,v in the current static graph
            such that- degree of u < (fso_per_node-1) and degree of v <= (fso_per_node - 1)
            a) compute shortest path P between u and v 
               such that for each node n other than u,v that exists on path u-->v and
               self.static_graph, the degree of n <= (fso_per_node - 2)
            b)if
              there is new node on this path then compute path-benefit(u-->v) and path-benefit(v-->u)
              and save the path which has max-benefit and also the path
          5. if there is one such-max-benefit path, add the PATH (IMP: not all possible edges) 
              to the static graph and remove the new nodes on the path from available node list
          6. if no path was added in the last iteration, break the loop

    rather this method uses getValidShortesPathForStaticGraph() which returns the full path (not just
